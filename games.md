Gods and Mortals is an chaotic, assymetric four-player fighting game. This is a final project we created in our game development class (Eecs 494). The four of us had to cooperate to create a fun, multiplayer game for the end-of-the-year showcase, where more than 200 people attended.

In the game, there are two human mortals trying to survive while killing each other. There is also a God, who's objective is to save both of them, and a Devil, who is attemping to destroy both of them. The result? A chaotic free-for-all game.
