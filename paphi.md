## Experiences

<br>

### President

As the current president of Pi Alpha Phi, I serve as the face of the organization. Not only am I responsible for all the events and actions of Pi Alpha Phi, I must oversee them, working with many members of the organization to organize the events smoothly. Such planning includes philanthropy trips, brotherhood bondings, professional workshops, and internal chapter meetings. 

In addition, I must cooperate with representatives from multiple other organizations outside of Pi Alpha phi to arrange collaborative events, whether social or business. No matter who and what chair is responsible for the planning, it is my duty to guide them and oversee the entire process.

Whether it is experience in event-planning or communication, I must utilize all these skills in order to manage Pi Alpha Phi. However, the main concept I learned from being president is not one you can find anywhere else: leadership. No matter what previous experienve I have, as a leader, it is important to integrate these experiences to motivate others, guide them, and ultimately improve the organization as a whole. That is the greatest challenge that I'd like to say I've overcome.

### New-Member Recruitment Chair

The new-member recruitment chair taught me event-planning skills. Throughout this time period, I've arranged mixers, social gatherings, game nights, dinner parties, formal interviews, etc. Working with other organizations, I've held multi-organization events; having a strict budget, I often had to handle logistics for many occasions. In essence, holding this chair let me dive straight into the heart of event-planning through first-hand experiences.

### Performance Chair/Choreographer

I have a passion for dancing, which lead me to become the performance chair and choreographer of Pi Alpha Phi. I had to prepare dances for many shows throughout the year. Such shows include the Multi-Cultural Greek Exhibition, which displays the talent of a large variety of greek organizations, and many small-scaled charity shows. Lastly, I had to prepare a performance for one of the largest Asian culturals of the year, named Generation APA. Generation APA is at the end of the year, where more than five-hundred spectators attended. In a few month's time period, I've held practices throughout every week until the event. From this experience, I've had the privilege to work with many talented individuals, and gained leadership and collaborative experience.
