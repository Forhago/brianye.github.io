## **Where the Light Doesn't Touch** (awarded first place in competition!)

Where the Light Doesn't Touch is a single-player puzzle game created by four people (including me) for a Game Jam competition at the University of Michigan. The Game Jam is an event in which programmers group up into fours and create a game within 48 hours. The top three teams with the best games will be awarded prizes, and in this event, my group achieved first place.

In the game, the protagonist must kill the lion king, who resides at the end of every level. The entire game is tile-based, and time only ticks when the player makes a move. Hence, the enemies will only move depending on the player. This adds a whole new complexity into the puzzle. 

The game also utilizes a "spotlight" type of vision. This vision can be obstructed by natural obstacles such as rocks and grass, but will not be hindered by water. The map begins as an unknown territory that is revealed as the player continues to explore it.

We wanted to keep the game as simple as possible, and so the entire game is functioned with only 4 buttons (moving). To maintain the player's interest, a large variety of enemies have been implemented, some of which are birds that can fly, wolves that chase faster, or moles that can teleport. The difficulty gradually increases as the player moves past the levels.

Gods and Mortals is an chaotic, assymetric four-player fighting game. This is a final project we created in our game development class (Eecs 494). The four of us had to cooperate to create a fun, multiplayer game for the end-of-the-year showcase, where more than 200 people attended.

In the game, there are two human mortals trying to survive while killing each other. There is also a God, who's aim is to save both of them, and a Devil, who is attemping to destroy both of them. Each role has access to their own unique spells in order to complete their goals. The result? A chaotic free-for-all side-scroller.
