# Overview
From the summer of 2016, and throughout my senior year of college, I've been working at a startup compnay called Suitcase LLC, located in downtown Ann Arbor. The product we develop is BrideVue. Bridevue is an application for users to plan wedding events. Through various visual techniques and realistic art styles, we bring the imagination onto the screen with an easy click of a button.

# My Contributions and Experience

After interning with them full-time over the summer of 2016, I continued working for them as a part-timer throughout my senior year, and is currently working there right now. Although at first, I had absolutely no experience in anything that they did, including the utilization of the Unity Game Engine, or REST APIs, I was flexible enough to learn quickly. Now, I am currently the head programmer after the former one left, and I can confidently say that I understand the project enough to lead it.

Working at a startup has taught me multiple things. Since the team is extremely small, I had to learn how to cooperate with others, even if it is with just one other programmer. Everything happens quickly, and I must improvise many things on the fly. I also had to take charge of many projects, and think creatively and quickly in order to solve complex issues. Many of the times there was noone I could ask for help besides myself, which further challenged me to put in more effort.

Throughout my job here, I've been shaped into the programmer I am now. I'd argue that I learned more here at a startup than anywhere else I could have worked, and I will take my experience into any future challenges I will face.
